    # draw_line_on_image  Draw a line on an image. The line is specified using
    # the theta and rho parameters of its normal form. The pixels corresponding
    # to the line are set to 255. The other pixels are not touched. The input
    # should be a grayscale image (numpy matrix of pixels).
    #
    # Syntax:
    #   image_out = draw_line_on_image( image_in_pixels, theta, rho )

    # Input:
    #   in_image = The grayscale image on which to draw the line. Type: numpy array
    #   theta = The angle of the line in degrees. Horizonal is 0.
    #   rho = The length of the perpendicular bisector in pixels.
    #
    # Output:
    #   image_out_pixels = The image with the line drawn. Type: numpy array
